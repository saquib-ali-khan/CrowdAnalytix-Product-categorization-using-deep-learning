# CrowdAnalytix-Product-categorization-using-deep-learning
This was a public contest held on CrowdAnalytix, where it was intended to classify any given product (Maybe Tshirts, bag, shoes, slippers,  key ring, or any product that you can think of) on e-commerce websites according to the type of Superhero depicted on it.
The problem looks trivial, but given the kind of product images, it's not.
